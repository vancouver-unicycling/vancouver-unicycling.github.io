Hello and welcome to VanUni!

We are a group of folks passionate about unicycling. If you are interested in learning, or looking to ride with other unicyclists in the Greater Vancouver Area, then look no further!

To find out about when we are meeting please join our Facebook Group as that is the primary place where we organize our rides and events.
