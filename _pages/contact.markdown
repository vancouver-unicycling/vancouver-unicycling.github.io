We are an informal group of unicyclists in the Vancouver area who get together and ride. Rides vary quite a bit, from off-road to trials/street to distance rides. We even play unicycle hockey!

We love having beginners come along, and are always happy to teach, so come say hi see what unicycling is all about!

To contact the group, arrange a ride, or ask questions please join our Google Group or send us an email at:
